# Data Getter - No Nav Edition 

## Overview

The **Data Getter - No Nav Edition** is a Lightning Web Component (LWC) designed for use in Salesforce Screen Flows. It enables users to execute SOQL queries and display the resulting records on the same screen. This avoids the need for additional navigation, streamlining the user experience.

## Features

- **SOQL Query Input**: Allows users to input a general text query directly.
- **Integration**: We use integration to convert the general text to SOQL.
- **Real-Time Data Display**: Shows query results dynamically on the same screen.

## This is a sample implementation with Location object, modify the XML for your requirement.

- If something breaks, it might be because of the invalid API key.
- Try Creating a new key and use it in the code.
